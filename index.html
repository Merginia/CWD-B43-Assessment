              </p>
              <br>
              <h4 class="red-text text-lighten-2">Key reasons why breaks are important:</h4>
            <p>1. Stress reduction:

            <p>2. Mental refreshment: 
            Breaks allow your mind to detach from a task, giving it a chance to recharge and return with renewed focus. </p>
            <p>3. Improved creativity: 
            Stepping away from a problem can often lead to fresh perspectives and more creative solutions. </p>
            <p> 4. Increased energy levels: 
            Regular breaks help combat fatigue and maintain energy throughout the day. </p>
            <p>5. Better concentration: 
            <p>By preventing mental exhaustion, breaks can improve your ability to focus on tasks. </p>
            <p> 6. Physical health benefits: </p>
            <p>Breaks can be used to engage in light physical activity, which can improve circulation and reduce muscle tension.</p> 
            <p> 7. Mood boost: 
            Taking time for yourself to relax and do something 
            enjoyable can elevate your mood and overall well-being.

              <p> Here are some tips for taking breaks:</p>
              <p>1. Choose your task(s).  </p>
              <p>2. Set a timer for 25 minutes. Itâ€™s preferred to use an old-fashioned timer (bonus points if you use a Pomodoro tomato timer), but an online timer works as well.</p>
              <p>3. Work on the task for 25 minutes uninterrupted, minimizing all distractions. Dial-in and focus! Once your 25 minutes is up, you've completed one Pomodoro session. Keep track of your completed Pomodoros by putting a checkmark or tally on a piece of paper, and record what you achieved during your working session.</p>
              <p>4.Enjoy a 5-minute break. </p>
              <p>5. Repeat the process! </p>
              <p>6. After four Pomodoros, treat yourself to an extended break, say, somewhere between 15-30 minutes. </p>
              <br>
              <p>That's it! It's that simple. </p>
